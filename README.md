 A C code is used to simulate the evolution of dark matter. We use a lagrangian approach through the particle mesh method.

 In order to run it correctly, as of now, you firstly have to run the makefile "makefileInit", then run the Init executable, then run the makefile "makefile" to compile the Main, to finally run Main.
 
Future developments include:
  a FFT implementation to solve the Vlasov-Poisson equation in the special case of the dark matter
  a leap-frog integration
  

This is, clearly, a work in progress..
